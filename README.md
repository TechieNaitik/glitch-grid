# Glitch Grid

A fast‑paced, real‑time multiplayer arena game built using **Flask**, **Flask‑SocketIO**, and an HTML5 Canvas frontend. Players glide across a neon grid, leaving glowing trails behind them. Collide with a wall, trail, or another player — and you're out. Last survivor wins the round.

---

## 🎮 Features

* Real‑time multiplayer gameplay
* Neon HSL color‑based player identities
* Smooth movement at ~25 FPS using a server‑side game loop
* Dynamic trail rendering with fading opacity
* Automatic round reset with countdown
* Persistent score tracking across rounds
* Collision detection for walls, trails, and player heads
* Safe random spawning (avoids collisions)
* Minimal, retro‑styled UI

## 🧠 Game Mechanics

### Movement & Trails

* Each player moves on a **30×30 grid**.
* Movement is controlled by arrow keys or WASD.
* Players leave behind a **20‑segment fading trail**.
* Colliding with any trail, wall, or head results in instant death.

### Round System

* A round ends when only **one player remains**.
* The winner gets **+1 score**.
* A countdown appears before the next round begins automatically.

### Player Uniqueness

* Each player gets a **unique neon color** generated by `generate_unique_color()`.
* Colors persist even after disconnects.

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/TechieNaitik/glitch-grid.git
cd glitch-grid
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```
python -m venv venv

## ▶️ Running the Game

Start the Flask‑SocketIO server:

```
python app.py
```

Then open the game in any browser:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

The game auto‑loads and waits for players to join.
To test multiplayer, open multiple browser tabs.

If you want to, you can join from **other devices on the same network** by entering:

```
http://<host_server_ipv4_address>:5000
```

## 🧩 Technologies Used

* **Flask** — Backend framework
* **Flask‑SocketIO** — Real‑time WebSocket communication
* **Socket.IO JS** — Client‑side websocket layer
* **HTML5 Canvas** — Graphics rendering
* **JavaScript** — Frontend logic
* **CSS** — Styling and UI effects

---

## 🔧 Configuration

Game settings are controlled in `app.py`:

```
GRID_SIZE = 30
TILE_SIZE = 20
MAX_TRAIL_LENGTH = 20
```

These affect both gameplay and rendering.

## 📦 Dependencies

From `requirements.txt`:

```
Flask==3.1.2
Flask_SocketIO==5.5.1
```
